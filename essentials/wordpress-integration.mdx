We will guide you through the process of integrating Rendless with WordPress.
It is a simple process that requires some lines of code.

You will learn how to generate dynamic og images in WordPress using Rendless.

# Step 1: Create a template and prepare it

First, you need to create a template on the Rendless dashboard. 
You can create a template by clicking on the "Create template" button on the [Templates page](https://rendless.com/templates).

Create a template with the desired design and content. Add variables to the template that you want to replace with dynamic data with the {{variable}} syntax.

Learn more about [dynamic images with variables](/essentials/variables).

<Frame
  caption="Template example, dynamic variables are marked with {{}}"
>
  <img src="/images/wordpress-tuto-1.png" alt="Before image" className="rounded-xl" />
</Frame>

In the example above, the template has a title and an image. The title is marked with {{title}} and the image URL is marked with {{image}}. By default the template will render the title and the image URL that you have uploaded.
