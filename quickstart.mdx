## Account creation and template creation

## Image generation

After creating a template, you can generate an image using [the simple render API](/references/simple-url). You need to provide the template ID and the data to be rendered in the image.

for example this call :

```bash
curl -X GET https://rendless.com/api/simple-url/TEMPLATE_ID?name=John
```

In this example, the template ID is `TEMPLATE_ID` and the dynamic data to be rendered is `name=John`.
This call returns a URL to the generated image.

Lean more about the [dynamic images with variables](/variables).

You could diretly use this URL in your website or app to display the generated image as og image in your head tag.

```html
<meta
  property="og:image"
  content="https://rendless.com/api/simple-url/TEMPLATE_ID?name=John"
/>
```
